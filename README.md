# Multicore-Video-Processing
Study on different Multicore Video Processing Methods


Each Code has line 

cam=cv2.VideoCapture(0)

to capture video from a webcam and then process it, to get consistant and correct (i.e. studyable results) use videos from the videos folder using the command

cam=cv2.VideoCapture( <directory of videofile> )

All the videos in the foldder are essentially the same video in different lengths and reolutions. Using these on these alorithms give consistant results.

Consult the ppt and report for motivations and results
